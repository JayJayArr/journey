# Docker

Doker is one of the best things I encountered at work which makes a lot of things a lot faster.

Need a quick ubuntu machine that you will throw away right after you tested two commands? - Sure thing.
Want a local SQL-Server for development? - No problem!
You want to test that new application that might be useful? - They might have an image ready for you.
Installing something into PROD? - just a few commands and seconds away.

### Portainer.io

If you are new to Docker or love to have a UI with Docker (that is, if you are not using Docker Desktop), this might come in handy.
One of our apprentices came to me a few days ago and told me about [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io).
If you prefer a UI on top of Docker there it is, ready for PROD, you can even restrict management of some containers to certain groups.
