# Markdown

Documentation is hard. Always was, always will be.

Where should your documentation be, what should it look like? How should it be read?
It definitely should be:

- easily available
- easy to search through
- close to the subject it is about, both logically and physically
- easily transferable to another tool if it is not in your codebase
- easy to read for everyone(a topic for another day)

One thing that checks all the boxes is markdown.
For example this book is written in Markdown, and it is awesome.
Of course, if you want to format something in a fancy way to present it somewhere, then it might not be the right choice.
But for a quick doc about the thing you did this week? It has all you need:

1. easy formatting, syntax highlighting
2. tables
3. lists
4. code blocks
5. links

And most importanly it can be read without being **rendered**. Unlike HTML, which cannot be read by most humans in its pure form.
Transferring a document from markdown to anything else?
No problem, there might even be an automatic converter for that.
But try it the other way around and it might get a lot more difficult.
So why not keep your docs in this simple format.

Render it into a webpage every day if you want to.
But if you ever need to transfer it anywhere else it will be a lot easier than most other things.
