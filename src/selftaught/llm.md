# AI/LLMs

The AI hype is real. Most likely you as well have heard sentinces like the following:

- AI will replace x amount of jobs.
- If you don't start using AI right now you will lose y.
- ... AI revolution ...

Somehow people still think that anything that can talk must be intelligent and it shows.

### Where AI really sucks vs. what it is good at

One of the best opinions where AI is good at is in NoBoilerplate's video [AI is not designed for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lxk9NMeWHg).
It perfectly describes why AI is good for basic tasks but gets worse the more detail or expertise one requires from it.
It is called "Large Language Model" for a reason.
If there is not a lot of texts available on a topic you cannot train a LARGE language model.
