# Teaching myself JS

One of the best languages to start coding in my opinion is JavaScript.

Why?
You can't do everything in JavaScript, but you can do ALMOST everything.
You can create an UI(thats's where JS shines, that's what it is mostly used for), a small backend, microservices, even some short scripts to speed up small taks you have daily.

And there is a npm package for basically anything. Frameworks for almost all use cases.
This week I even found a npm package where you can manage your Axis cameras.

FullStack applications are easiest to create with JavsScript.
Of course there are "better" languages for everything I just named, a backend might be more performant in Go, Rust, Java, whatever.
And a script or some data science might be easier in a Python script or a Jupyter notebook.
But getting some easy HTTP requests out, writing to and reading from your file-system, GRPC, ORMs, a small Express.js server, its all there, as a first language its really perfect.
At this point in my journey I did not ask that magical question of whether I SHOULD write something in JS, I was happy that I could create it at all.

JS is also known for all the weird things it might be doing, all the 1+1 = 11 stuff.
You will struggle why those objects are not equal although they have completely the same values.
It might be confusing, but it also lets you make some errors that teach you a valuable lesson.

Whenever you have stumbled over pointers/references, types or anything that JS is not fit to do, then you are rady to move on.
My recommendation for a first enhancement is [Typescript](./typescript.md) or if you are very brave, have a look at my chapter about [Rust](./Rust.md).
