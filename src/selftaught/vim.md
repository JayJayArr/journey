# VIM Motions

One of the greatest thing I got to know are the vim motions.
I first learned about them in a video about developer workflow and thought it was stupid to do everything via the keyboard.

But after having a look they are great. They take some time to learn, and I am sure I am not using them to the full potential.
Having an option to delete everything inside some braces is awesome, a quick "d i {" and it is done instead of having to grab the mouse and marking it all by hand.

The synergy between vim motions and markdown is also insanely good. I started taking notes in markdown using Obsidian (heavily inspired by NoBoilerplate i gotta say).
After some time playing with vim someone told me there are vim motions also in Obsidian which globalizes the workflow across the different tools.

What surprised me even more is that vim motions are practically everywhere in development tools. From VS Code, across all editors.

If you can type quickly, the next step is vim motions.
