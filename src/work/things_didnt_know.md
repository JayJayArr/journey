# There is a journey ahead of you

You started a job after studying and didn't know about RDP? What else didn't you know?

Well here is a _small_ list in no particular order, I will keep it updated as I hopefully learn more stuff.
If you are looking for some inspiration this might be a good place to look:

- IP addresses, Netmasks, Gateways, including how to track and manage them
- linux, all the different distros
- HTTP verbs
- HTTP error codes
- SSL, TLS, HTTPS
- websockets, socket.io
- clustering
- microservices
- command line
- virtualization
- DNS, DHCP
- NAT
- software dependencies - what do you mean the installer is not enough?
- MDT
- cron jobs
- SQL, database management
- Active Directory
- Project management
- Gantt charts
- SIP
- Jira
- Google is your friend
- switching things off and on REALLY solves 90% of problems
- containerization, Docker
- AI
- customer communication
- customer service is the first thing suffering when you lack time
- .bat scripts
- windows task scheduling
- OWASP
- JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, etc.
- git and github
- SMTP
- SNMP
- webhooks
- markdown, easily one of the best general purpose things to know! I love it!
- vim motions
- Ansible
- draw.io
- FTP/SFTP
- NTP
- Tree Shaking

The four stages of competence apply to each and every item in the list.
