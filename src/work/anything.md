# We can do anything

If you ever feel like you are doing everything and nothing, I know that feeling...

Your company most likely has some products it uses regularly, some may be standards, some may not.
However from time to time a customer comes around and requests a product you don't have experience with.
If you are in your sales team (whatever that means in your company) and have a case just like this, please go talk to your engineering team.
Either someone has touched this topic already or you might have to give them the time to play with it first.

The job of an engineer is constant change. Old tech is deprecated and new tech is created every day.
Can you really be "up to date" with anything? It certainly feels like you should be.
But at the same time you might not be given the time to test out that new feature, try integrating this new product you have just sold to a customer or even read the patch notes to your favourite project.

How do you do this?

In my opinion you have 2 options:

1. Learning by doing it... in advance - this sounds great, that's exactly how I learned most of the stuff I am doing today, playing around with it before realizing the common pitfalls and then adopting to them when you are doing it for the real project.
   This might bring you into a vicious circle of perfection.
   And this requires time, valueable time you might not have...
2. Doing it on the fly - you just look at the things you really have to implement.
   If you do it like this you might never get out of the loop of "learning just enough"

This boils down to the age old question of quantity vs quality, you either do a lot of stuff and risk doing it badly, or you limit the things you look at and do these things with a higher quality and risk falling into perfection.
As engineers we of course like to be able to help with whatever need you might have but there is a limited number of things to what a person can sustainably provide help with without going crazy.

Shoving new tech down your engineering teams throat is just as bad as forcing them to perfectly learn every single detail that MIGHT come up and having a way to adopt to it before setting something up in the first place.

If you are rapidly shuffling from left to right on this scale from extreme perfection in every detail to extreme rotation of products and tech, welcome to the club.
