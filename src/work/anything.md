# We can do anything

If you ever feel like you are doing everything and nothing, I know that feeling...

Your company most likely has some products it uses regularly, some may be standards, some may not.
However from time to time a customer comes around and requests a product you don't have experience with.
If you are in your sales team (whatever that means in your company) and have a case just like this, please go talk to your engineering team.
Either someone has touched this topic already or you might have to give them the time to play with it.

The job of an engineer is constant change. Old tech is deprecated and new tech is created every day.
Can you really be "up to date" with anything? It certainly feels like you should be.
But at the same time you might not be given the time to test out that new feature, try integrating this new product you have just sold to a customer or even read the patch notes to your favourite project.

How do you do this?

In my opinion you have x options:

1. Learning by doing - this sounds great, that's exactly how I learned most of the stuff I am doing today, playing around with it. But this requires time.
   Valueable time you might not have
2. Do it on the fly - you just look at the things you really have to implement. If you do it like this you will never get out of the loop of "learning just enough"
