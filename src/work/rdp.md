# What is Remote Desktop? - Endless learning

When I came out of university that was one of the first questions I asked in my job.
Can you believe it? I know it sounds ridiculous, but I had never heard about RDP in my life until that. Neither did I use it until then.
But I realized that there are some corners where I was missing knowledge and tried to find out about those corners.

Later in my life I got to learn about the four stages of competence:

1. Unconscious Competence (Ignorance)
2. Conscious Incompetence (Awareness)
3. Conscious Competence (Learning)
4. Unconscious Competence (Mastery)

When I heard about those stages I knew that at that time I was at the first stage, not knowing, and not knowing what knowledge I was missing.

Of course one has to apply those stages to every aspect of life.
You might have a mastery in one place but still be ignorant about other aspects without even realizing in which stage you are.

At the same time one cannot reliably tell in which stage he is without consulting others.
You might see yourself in another stage of competence then others.
The same goes for your view of others which makes the four stages a purely subjective view.
You will get the best picture when first assessing yourself and asking others about their point of view.

I unknowingly chose a job where I could learn forever, and I love it.
