# Things I want to get my hands dirty with

This is a list of all the stuff I have heard great things about and that I want to touch further than just running a simple tutorial on it:

- [ ] Kubernetes - It seems to be a blessing and a curse at the same time when running complex systems
- [ ] CI/CD - I have set up some githuv actions myself, but how do i really use Jest, Jenkins, CircleCI, Spinnaker.
      And more importantly, how do they work under the hood?
- [ ] GO - the gophers somehow are everywhere
- [ ] Database Engines - how do they work
- [ ] Game Engines - why is it an engine?
- [ ] Yocto Project - When do you use it, what does it actually do?
- [ ] Terraform
