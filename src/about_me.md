# Who is this dude?

For those of you who don't know me, hi, I'm Jakob.
I am currently working as an Application Engineer in a company doing physical security applications.
Apart from that I enjoy coding a lot since i picked it up. This is a collection of thoughts, ideas, ToDo's, maybe even some detailed notes.

This is my journey from my late youth until now, I will try to keep it as chronological as possible but forgive me if it is not perfect.
Some of the views here are a little controversial, i will try to stay as neutral as possible though.

### UAQ - Unfrequently asked questions

- Q: Application Engineer? So are you developing software?
- A: I will hit you with the classic "It depends" here. I sometimes do but most of it is during my personal time rather than at work.
  Most people would rather describe the "programming" we do here as "configuring".

- Q: Why are you writing this book?
- A: To be honest just to straighten my thoughts on the topic of software development, engineering and the industry.
  At the same time I was looking to document my journey through software and the ideas I am having (Publishing an Idea on the internet counts as a ghost of done).

- Q: Why should I read this?
- A: If you ask me like that you shouldn't. Go outside and play, read a book, try out something you wanted to do, whatever.
  If you want to read my thoughts on a specific topic or something that I have used for a long time there is a good chance you will find them here.
