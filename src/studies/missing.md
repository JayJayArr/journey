# What about ...?

I am not a full time teacher and things are good the way they are. But from time to time I may teach some new employees about soldering, basics of software engineering or some other stuff are desparately missing. So I went ahead and collected a list of stuff where I am surprised we NEVER touched them.

- JSON - Have a way to write down your objects
- Languages not containing a C - Always the right tool for the job?
- Communication protocols - you should have heard about HTTP, (g)RPC, Websockets, RDP, SIP, FTP as well as TCP, UDP, ICMP, SSH, SMTP, SNMP, DHCP...
- IP configuration - Subnets, Gateways, DHCP, DNS
- Git - No, I am serious! We developed software in a folder on our drive and would move that back and forth. After just a few hours of work we would have dozens of files containing different versions of the same code. Who needs a tool that can solve that mess, right?
