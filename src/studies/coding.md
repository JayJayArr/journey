# Coding in university

Coding and software development was not my favourite subject. I thought developing software was tedious, manipulating bits, bytes and arrays one at a time. Either I was missing all the interesting parts or we stayed at the very basics during university.

Keeping this chapter in the book short, bu if you are looking for a list of the stuff that I am still surprised we didn't touch in university skip ahead to the "What about...?" part.
