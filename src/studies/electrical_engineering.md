# Electrical Engineering 101

Welcome to Electrical Engineering 101, the first stop of our journey, I will be your guide through this turbulent time.How did we get here you might ask? Welp, I don't know either.

I did my A-Levels in 2016. Young me being immersed in studying didn't have many thoughts that there would be a time beyond the finals. The finals came and they went and suddenly I had nothing to do and didn't know what to do with my time.
My grades were okay-ish, not good enough to pick up something with a strict NC in university, but not bad enough to just start working (If I understand correctly it would translate to a 3.1 GPA but don't quote me on it).

So what would I do with my time? I was too late to apply for university but browsing the websites i found that one university had extended the application for one curriculum, and one only: ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. I realised I would not be going abroad like me sister (just not my thing at that time) so I applied and got a place.

So here we are in University, not really knowing why we are here and not really liking what we are studying. I liked math in school, but the math here is different. If you try telling me you are in Engineering because you like Math I will call you a liar, if that was true you would be studying Math directly.
Our professor made it clear to us, that half of us will not finish the Bachelor degree we started and he was right, by the end of the 7 semesters the eager 63 beginning students would be reduced to a mere 30 graduates.

Did I graduate? Yes, I did, it took some time but at the end it was worth it. But that would be too quick, and we are trying to talk about software here, so we should start in the second semester, where we started coding.
